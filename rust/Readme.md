# advent of code solutions 2020 using rust (and other?)

The main goal for this year is to learn some rust, but whenever I can think of an interesting way
to solve it differently I will add other solutions.

* run `cargo run day [data-name]`
* data-name is optional and defaults to `input`
* it will look for data in `../data/{day}-{data-name}.txt` and produce `../data/{day}-{data-name}-part-[1|2].txt`
